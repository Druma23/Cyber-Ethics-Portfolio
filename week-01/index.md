Ethics & Law Orientation (Week 1)

My Ethical Lens: 
  I believe Feminist ethics fits me. This is because I care strongly about helping people and doing what is best for everyone. I believe everyone should have a voice and be included. Also that rules should not be biased against marginalized groups.

Authorization Principle: 
  Authorization means whether or not you have permission to do or access something. For example, Hocking College has multiple Wifis, some are public and some require passwords. If you do not know the password to Wifi you do not have authorization to use it.

AI Use Note (if used):
