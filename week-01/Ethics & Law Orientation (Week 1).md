# Ethics & Law Orientation (Week 1) 

## My Ethical Lens: 
  I believe Feminist ethics fits me. This is because I care strongly about helping people and doing what is best for everyone. I believe everyone should have a voice and be included. Also that rules should not be biased against marginalized groups.

## Authorization Principle: 
  Authorization principle is whether or not you have permission from the owner to do or access something. For example, Hocking College has multiple Wifis, some are public and some require passwords. If you do not know the password to Wifi you do not have authorization to use it.

## Policy Snippet: 
Use of the Hocking College John Light 357 computer lab is limited to authorized users for cybersecurity and networking purposes within assigned scope. Users must access only resources for which they have explicit permission and must not perform testing, scanning, or data collection beyond approved tasks. Personal data shall be minimized and handled responsibly. Suspected exposure or misuse must be reported immediately to the Cybersecurity and Networking program advisor. Violations may result in loss of access and disciplinary action.

## Reflection: 
  I would refine it further by explaining exactly the effects it would have on stakeholders. I would do this by making sure I explain explicitly what is at stake if you were to break the AUP and how it would also be unethical potentially even illegal depending on what exactly you did. A worst case scenario of who all could be impacted by breaking the AUP could also be given to help steer individuals away from breaking it. 

## AI Use Note (if used):
  I used SAGE to help me better understand the ethical frameworks and study the material.
