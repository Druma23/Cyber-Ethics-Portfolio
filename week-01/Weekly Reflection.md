# Reflection: 

## What I learned: 
The ethical framework I will lean on this term is Feminist Ethics. Feminist ethics is about helping
marginalized groups and creating trust between these different groups. IEEE also focuses on treating every one equally and not 
discriminating. Both the ethical framework and professional code I listed above focus on equality and the safety of humans. In the "Ethics In Technology" 
book a quote from AI Carol Gilligan mentions that voices and perspectives can disappear when using the typical ethical frameworks which shows there can be
imbalances in power when using technology. When looking at Chapter 4 in the same book it mentions Apple intentionally slowing down phones and not
telling consumers they were doing it on purpose. Not only is this risky legal situation, but it is highly unethical if you look at it from a 
Feminist Ethics perspective lense becuase they are breaking trust between they customers for their own gain. 

## How I’ll apply it (1 paragraph): A concrete workplace or campus example where authorization must be explicit.

## Muddiest point (3–4 sentences): One precise question about “ethical vs. legal” or authorization/consent.
## Portfolio note (2–3 bullets): 
- Weekly Reflection

## AI use (allowed with disclosure): 
 I used SAGE to help me study and learn the material better. I asked her to explain ethical frameworks and professional codes in  a better way to me.
I also used SAGE to ask me questions based on the weekly reading to gauge what I needed to look over again.
