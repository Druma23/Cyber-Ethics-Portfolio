# Reflection: 

## What I learned: 
The ethical framework I will lean on this term is Feminist Ethics. Feminist ethics is about helping marginalized groups and creating trust between these different groups. IEEE also focuses on treating every one equally and not discriminating. Both the ethical framework and professional code I listed above focus on equality and the safety of humans. In the "Ethics In Technology" book a quote from AI Carol Gilligan mentions that voices and perspectives can disappear when using the typical ethical frameworks which shows there can be imbalances in power when using technology. When looking at Chapter 4 in the same book it mentions Apple intentionally slowing down phones and not telling consumers they were doing it on purpose. Not only is this a risky legal situation, but it is highly unethical if you look at it from a Feminist Ethics perspective lense becuase they are breaking trust between they customers for their own gain. 

## How I’ll apply it (1 paragraph):
 You're working at a hospital as an IT professional. A nurse is having trouble accessing a patients records and believes it might be something wrong with her computer and asks you to take a look. She also wants you to go ahead and send her the patients medical records so she can complete her task. While you can look at her computer to help remidiate the issue, you cannot look into a patients medical records and send them to her because you do not have the proper authorization to do that. If you were to access the medical records and send them it would not only be unethical, but also it would break HIPPA. The ACM professional code would also be broken due to you not respecting confidentiality. If you were to try to do that you could reach out to your boss, the head of the hospital, and possibly get consent from the patient in order to get written authorization. 

## Muddiest point (3–4 sentences): 
 If you have authorization to do something could it still be unethical? As in you have the approval, permission, and capabilities. Would it only be unethical depending on what ethical framework or lense you looked through?

## AI use (allowed with disclosure): 
 I used SAGE to help me study and learn the material better. I asked her to explain ethical frameworks and professional codes in a better way to me. I also used SAGE to ask me questions based on the weekly reading to gauge what I needed to look over again.
