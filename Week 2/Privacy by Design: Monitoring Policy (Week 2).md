## Principles Summary:
When someone is notified and has agreed to the terms/conditions, they've given their notice/consent. Data minimization is taking the least amount of data needed to complete a task, whereas purpose limitation makes sure data is only used for what it needs to be used for. Proportionality ties everything together by ensuring that one's privacy and the data collected are equal.  

## My Monitoring & Retention Clause:
A hospital will monitor activity on company-issued devices to protect operations and comply with policy. Monitoring will be limited to authorized purposes and assigned scope. Types of data collected may include access, security, and audit logs, and health records. Workers will be notified at sign-in and through the AUP. Personal communications and personal devices are not reviewed except as required by law or incident response.
The hospital will use purpose limitation and data minimization to collect the minimum data necessary. Also, it will restrict access to trained staff and will retain monitoring data for 30 days unless required longer for investigations or legal holds. Individuals may raise concerns or appeal via email to HR or the Cybersecurity team. Violations may result in loss of access and disciplinary action. The hospital policy follows HIPAA guidelines.

## Justification:
Within my monitoring and retention clause, I used notice, proportionality, data minimization, and purpose limitation principles to form my clause. Both HIPAA and the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act came into play when making my clause. This is due to its monitoring of electronic health records, including health insurance, and protecting the patients' privacy rights along with the employees'.

## Reflection (3â€“4 sentences): What you would tighten (e.g., retention length, appeals) and impact on stakeholders.
When looking back at my monitoring and retention clause, I found a spot that would need to be tightened. I would clarify what the data collected would be used for. This would impact the stakeholders by creating more trust and ensuring them that the data collected stays within the guidelines. Also, the data being collected is not being used unethically or mishandled.

## AI Use Note (if used):
I used SAGE to help me study the material. I also used SAGE to proofread and give me feedback on my Monitoring and Retention clause.
