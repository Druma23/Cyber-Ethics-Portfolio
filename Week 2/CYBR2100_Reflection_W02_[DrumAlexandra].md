## What I learned (6–8 sentences): Explain privacy principles you’ll use (notice/consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, proportionality). Tie to the eBook and one policy/code.
Policy Principles are rules that are put into place with the intent of protecting someone's privacy rights and how their data is managed. 
I will use data minimization and purpose limitation to make sure I am only using the necessary data which in turn will help me follow HIPAA guidelines.

## How I’ll apply it (1 paragraph): Redesign an example of workplace/student monitoring to make it proportional (state scope, notice, retention).


## Muddiest point (3–4 sentences): Ask one precise question about consent (explicit vs. implied), de-identification limits, or fairness.


## Portfolio note (2–3 bullets): What you will add to your site and why it matters.
-[ Monitoring and Retention Clause](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dhz9qMvzLghLPWbGtuH3yqaDqn5AaVWa/view?usp=drive_link). This Clause shows that I understand the material given and that I am able to use my knowledge to make my own form of a monitoring and retention clause. 


## AI use (allowed with disclosure):
I used SAGE to help me study the material. I also used SAGE to proofread and give me feedback on my Monitoring and Retention clause.
