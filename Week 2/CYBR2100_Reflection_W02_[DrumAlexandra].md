## What I learned (6–8 sentences): Explain privacy principles you’ll use (notice/consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, proportionality). Tie to the eBook and one policy/code.
Policy Principles are rules that are put into place with the intent of protecting someone's privacy rights and how their data is managed. 
I will use data minimization and purpose limitation to make sure I am only using the necessary data which in turn will help me follow HIPAA guidelines.

## How I’ll apply it:
  A business monitors employees' activity on their computers with no scope for what data they collect, when they collect it, or for how long. To revise this, I would first have a notification at the time of sign-in and through the AUP. I would make it clear that the business will only monitor activity on company-issued computers and only during work hours. The type of data collected would be websites visited and security and access logs. Personal devices would not be reviewed unless required by law or incident response. The business would use purpose limitation and data minimization to collect the minimum data necessary. The monitoring data would be stored for 30 days unless longer is required for legal holds or investigations. Concerns and appeals would be an email to HR or the cybersecurity team. If violations occurred, individuals may be subject to disciplinary action or loss of access. By revising the above statement this way, it makes the situation proportional because it provides a balance between data collected and user privacy. Also, it provides a clear scope, a notice about the data being monitored, and it shows a clear retention policy.

## Muddiest point (3–4 sentences):
Can something be both explicit and implied consent at the same time? For example, if you clicked "I agree" to an EULA or ToS, that would be explicit consent. If you were to click "I agree" and within the agreement, you agreed to, it said "such as", would it also then be implied consent?

I used SAGE to help me study the material. I also used SAGE to proofread and give me feedback on my Monitoring and Retention clause.
