  A hospital will monitor activity on company-issued devices to protect operations and comply with policy. Monitoring will be limited to authorized purposes and assigned scope. Types of data collected may include access, security, and audit logs, and health records. Workers will be notified at sign-in and through the AUP. Personal communications and personal devices are not reviewed except as required by law or incident response.
  
  The hospital will use purpose limitation and data minimization to collect the minimum data necessary. Also, it will restrict access to trained staff and will retain monitoring data for 30 days unless required longer for investigations or legal holds. Individuals may raise concerns or appeal via email to HR or the Cybersecurity team. Violations may result in loss of access and disciplinary action. The hospital policy follows HIPAA guidelines.
