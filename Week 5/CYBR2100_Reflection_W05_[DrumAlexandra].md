## What I learned (6–8 sentences):
Policy helps move the standard, procedures perform standards, and guidelines help provide flexibility. Another way to look at it is policy is the what, standards are the must, procedures are the how, why, when, and guidelines are the shoulds. These combined make the GRC. Accountability is created by deciding on transparent ownership to accept risk, providing approvers to sign the higher risk actions, having review cadences for policy review, and enforcing compliance with the guidelines in place. The ebook Ethics in Technology by Ed Weber talks about making "choices that support transparency, fairness, and accountability”. Everything listed above is a choice that helps show transparency and accountability. A business's AUP supports ethical use of technology and is typically reviewed by compliance teams. This helps to show accountability, and it would also support ethical frameworks like Feminist ethics by establishing trust in business practices. 

## How I’ll apply it:
Two ROE clauses I would consider essential are explicit scope & stop-test and data handling & retention. Explicit scope & stop-test are essential because one needs to know exactly what they are authorized to look at and test. This protects them from overstepping and having legal repercussions. Also, it has a process in place to stop testing if there is an issue that happens that everyone is protected. Data handling and retention are essential because they protect one's sensitive data, which provides trust between the stakeholders. It helps decide how PII data is stored and handled, or any other sensitive data. Both of these clauses are to make sure HIPAA is being followed and also tie into Feminist Ethics by providing trust between stakeholders, and making sure everyone's data is handled properly with transparency.

## Muddiest point: 
What are some indicators that an issue needs to be escalated to a higher priority or needs to be escalated to a higher team? Looking at risk factors and conditions can help point you in the right direction of what level of priority an issue needs to be handled at, but in the instance that you are unable to determine the severity of the issue. Is it better to escalate higher just in case or should you start low and escalate up from there? 

## Portfolio note (2–3 bullets): What you’ll add to your site and why it matters.
- ROE Outline - This lets me prove that I know how to do a ROE Outline and read one.
- ROE Starter Pack - Shows that I understand the material and I can find areas to improve on. 
## AI use: 
I used SAGE to double check my reflection to make sure I did not miss any key points. I also used SAGE to help me study the material.
