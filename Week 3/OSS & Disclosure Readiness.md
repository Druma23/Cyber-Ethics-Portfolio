##License Choice (3–4 sentences): 
 GPL is a copyleft license which means the derivative work must open-sourced and also under the same license. On the other hand MIT & Apache are proprietary tools and support commercial use. They are also easier to modify. All three require attribution to the authors.
 
## Initial Vulnerability Report Template:
[Inital Vulnerability Report Template
](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15dDKaFRR-kY_mX2ObavWBW4YTx9XHxxc/view?usp=drive_link). I made a spreadsheet and included an example for each category. 

## Justification (1 short paragraph): Cite one OER (CISA VDP or OSI/Choose a License).
The CISA VDP talks about transparency and risk mitigation. Transparency is necessary when dealing with vulnerabilities and license issues because it keeps the trust that the feminist ethical framework relies on when making sure all parties are being treated fairly. OSI makes sure that the license being used is following all the requirments of an open-source license if not then it will not be approved. All of these come into play with intital vulnerability report template becuase the CISA VDP helps midigate issues and that helped me make my template. The OSI came into play with the example I gave due to the GPL-license code being in the propritary software. All of this goes back to feminist ethics with the trust, transparency, and doing what is best for society. 

## Evidence Links: 
- [“Open Source, Closed Eyes”  ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OXlibXZVPmsiwvcPNeWHBlyYD0y2HEz8/view?usp=drive_link)
- [Reflection](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyQWSS3xRb-6X5Pmjr0SReDIYwlIkwWg/view?usp=drive_link)
  
## Reflection (3–4 sentences): What you would refine next and stakeholder impacts.
I would refine the mitigation plan and be more detailed on the step by step process and also list more ways to workaround or mitigate the issue. I was stress more on the importance of coordinating and communicating with the stakeholders in a timely manner. By doing this it would help save the loss of reputation, build trust, and show transparency. 

## AI Use Note (if used).
I used SAGE to help me understand the material.
