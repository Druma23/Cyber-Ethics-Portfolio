## What I learned (6–8 sentences): 
All three licenses (MIT, GPL, Apache) require attribution to the authors. GPL license is the only license of the three that uses a copyleft and it is a strong copyleft. The other two allow proprietary use. On the other hand MIT does not make patent terms, but GPL and Apache do. Apache has explicit patent terms whereas GPL has implicit patent terms. The ebook, Ethics in Technology, mentions how the licenses allowed innovators to benefit from their work while also benefiting society and it also brought up how the licenses were “ethically motivated” by doing what was best for society, but also protecting the innovators of these designs. The Choose a License website also showed the Unlicense which has no conditions and is for the “public domain”. All of these prove that there is an ethical and legal decision to be made when choosing a license and selecting one that is best for society. 

## How I’ll apply it: 
### MIT License
- As long as you include attributions and original license, MIT is very easy to distribute
- Minimal friction, since not very many rules on its reuse
- High compatibility with other licenses, which makes it great for internal tools 

## Muddiest point (3–4 sentences): 
A company is using dual licensing and is providing the same software under an open-source license for free and a commercial license for profit. While they are making a profit and also providing it for free, is it an ethical decision? I understand the ability for the company to not only make money, but also provide flexibility is a great idea, my question is on how ethical it is.
