## Facts (≤10 bullets)
-GPL is copyleft meaning must use the same copyleft terms when distributing a derivative 
-If there is a GPL component ,the tool needs to be distributed as GPL 
-Can be a hurdle for companies using proprietary software 

## Issues (1–3 questions)
-Was this tool already shipped outside the organization? 
-Could the GPL-licensed code be removed easily from the proprietary software? 
-Was the proprietary software changed to be distributed under the GPL license before it was sent out? 

## Ethical analysis (1 paragraph) 
When looking at the scenario given I used a Feminist ethical framework lens to evaluate it. First off, the feminist ethical framework focuses on trust, helping others, and creating relationships. The scenario above does the opposite of that and in turn causes a few concerns. Since, the developer used a GPL-licensed code in proprietary software, they broke the legal terms and the GPL stance of the work staying open and free. This causes the scenario to be unethical and illegal due there being broken legal terms, along with breaking trust to users.

## Legal/policy analysis (1 paragraph)
Under the GPL License, which is copyleft,  you can redistribute the GPL-licensed code, but there are a few stipulations. You can redistribute the GPL-licensed code, but it has to be distributed under the same GPL license. That means it cannot be distributed under proprietary software. This also means that you cannot mix the two and call it a closed-source product. 

## Decision & rationale (1 paragraph)
As a remediation plan, I would suggest that they immediately stop the distribution of it. Next, I would suggest open-sourcing the proprietary tool if they cannot remove the GPL-licensed code. They could then re-release it under the GPL. Along with this, they should notify the people that received/used the proprietary tool and offer an apology. To be even more transparent they could provide the remediation plan and a timeframe of how long it will take to fix. I am suggesting this because it would most likely be the quickest solution and it could be possible the GPL can’t be removed.

## Alternatives considered (bullets)
An alternative solution could be to replace the GPL-licensed code
- Con: It would probably take a lot more time. It would also use a lot more resources and be harder to accomplish 
- Pro: It would keep the proprietary tool proprietary.
