## What I learned (6–8 sentences): 
The NIST incident lifecycle follows a well-thought-out list of stages to help with the approach for helping with cybersecurity incidents. The stages are Preparation, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned. These help to ensure that incidents are being responded to promptly with the minimum necessary measures. Minimum necessary matters because it helps protect the individuals in the incident, lessens the number of people exposed, can decrease the risk, and leads to a quicker review. The ebook discusses how “digital identity” can be made up of “personally identifiable information (PII)”. When going through the incident, we want to keep as much of this information as we can out to protect privacy and lessen the risk.
 
## How I’ll apply it (1 paragraph): 
A small business urgent care has patients using an online portal when they come in to make the check-in process quicker. There are a couple of items you can capture, the first being the reason for the visit. This will help the staff determine how urgent the patient needs to be seen or if they need to go to the ER. The second item to capture would be the patient's name, so they can identify the person. One item to avoid would be collecting a full medical history. At the time of check-in, the individual's entire medical history should not be needed and would exceed the scope of checking in. Also, it could increase the chance of privacy risk, violate the minimum necessary, and potentially violate HIPAA if there isn’t proper consent.

## Muddiest point (3–4 sentences): 
How can one ensure that redactions cannot be reverse engineered? For example, if you blurred out a piece of PII how can one make sure that someone could not find a way to unblur it to get the information. Is there always a chance that someone could find a way to gain access to redacted information?  

## Portfolio note (2–3 bullets):
[Incident & Evidence Note](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-BeHrfIRUP1auCXtkMng-dA-Pf2VrE7w/view?usp=drive_link) - This helps me prove that I understand the material and can put my knowledge of the material into practice
[Incident Ethics & Evidence Notes](https://github.com/Druma23/Cyber-Ethics-Portfolio/blob/main/Week%204/Incident%20Ethics%20%26%20Evidence%20Notes.md) - This assignment helps me further understand the material given and helps me figure out ways to improve my work. 

## AI use:
I used SAGE to help me study the material. I also used SAGE to proofread and give me feedback on my What I Learned summary.
